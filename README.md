# Project Overview

This project analyzes historical National Stock Exchange (NSE) market data to examine the statistical behavior of price movements and explore potential market regimes. The dataset was collected from year-wise historical records, cleaned, standardized, and consolidated into a single master dataset for analysis.

The study focuses on computing log returns, evaluating volatility patterns, examining distributional properties such as skewness and kurtosis, testing stationarity using the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test, and analyzing relationships between returns, trading volume, and turnover. The goal is to understand structural characteristics of market dynamics and build a foundation for identifying regime shifts such as high- and low-volatility periods.

This work establishes a statistically grounded framework for further financial modeling and regime detection using advanced probabilistic or machine learning approaches.
