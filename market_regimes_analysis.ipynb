    "Financial markets do not move in a smooth or uniform manner over time. Instead, they tend to operate in distinct phases where market behavior remains relatively stable before shifting to a new phase. These phases are commonly referred to as market regimes. In this notebook, we analyze NIFTY 50 index data to examine whether such regime-like behavior is visible through simple financial indicators such as returns, volatility, and drawdowns\n"

    "## Understanding Market Regimes\n",
    "\n",
    "A market regime is a sustained phase during which market behavior remains relatively stable in its statistical and structural characteristics. Rather than moving in a smooth or uniform manner, financial markets shift between distinct states defined by varying levels of risk, momentum, volatility, and investor sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Different regimes produce distinct return characteristics:\n",
    "Bull regimes typically show positive average returns with mild right skewness.\n",
    "Bear regimes exhibit negative average returns and greater downside asymmetry.\n",
    "Range-bound regimes fluctuate around zero with relatively thin tails.\n",
    "Crisis regimes display fat tails, meaning extreme moves occur more frequently than expected."
